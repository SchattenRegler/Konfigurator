# Konfigurator

**Konfigurator** is a cross-platform Flutter application for configuring, visualizing, and managing facade sectors and solar control logic. It is designed for building automation, facade planning, and smart shading projects, supporting import/export, mapping, and bus address configuration.

## Key Features

- **Facade Sector Management:** Create, edit, and remove facade sectors with custom properties (orientation, horizon, louvre, bus addresses, etc.).
- **Mapping & Geolocation:** Select facade points and visualize sectors on an interactive map (OpenStreetMap imagery).
- **Solar Calculations:** Calculate and visualize solar paths and angles for each sector using `solar_calculator` and `fl_chart`.
- **Bus Address Integration:** Configure KNX/field bus addresses for brightness, irradiance, azimuth, elevation, and more.
- **File Import/Export:** Save and load project files (`.sunproj`) for easy sharing and backup.
- **Modern UI:** Responsive navigation, dialogs for orientation and location, and address autocomplete.
- **Cross-Platform:** Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and Web.

## Project Structure

- `lib/main.dart` – App entry point, navigation, and main configuration logic
- `lib/sector.dart` – Sector data model and sector editing widget
- `lib/facade_orientation_dialog.dart` – Dialog for selecting and visualizing facade orientation
- `lib/location_dialog.dart` – Dialog for selecting a single point (lat/lng) on the map
- `assets/` – App assets (SVGs, icons, etc.)
- `test/` – Widget and unit tests

## Usage Overview

1. **Create or open a project**: Start a new configuration or load an existing `.sunproj` file.
2. **Configure general settings**: Set version, bus addresses, and azimuth/elevation options.
3. **Manage sectors**: Add, edit, or remove facade sectors. Set orientation, horizon, louvre, and bus addresses for each sector.
4. **Map & solar tools**: Use dialogs to select facade points on the map and visualize solar paths.
5. **Save/export**: Export your configuration for use in building automation systems.
